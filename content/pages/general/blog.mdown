# New Blog

Well, here it is. A new blog I won't post to.

I always figure I should have something here. More than just a page telling you my webserver is working. I'm not great about blogging but I thought I would give this a try. In the next few days I will fix things up and make them look better. I also have a few projects in the works I will post about.

Enjoy.
